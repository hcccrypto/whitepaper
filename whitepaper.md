HealthCareCoin

HealthCareCoin - cryptocurrency will help the fight against Covid-19.

HealthCareCoin is the first coin specially created to provide targeted assistance to people affected by Covid-19 and regions facing a difficult epidemiological situation. 

The Covid-19 pandemic is one of the critical threats for the whole world today. The disease has already claimed many thousands of lives and destroyed the lives of millions of people and caused enormous economic damage. In many regions of the world, the healthcare system cannot cope with the influx of patients and is collapsing. 

Fortunately, millions of people worldwide want to help those who were less fortunate during this pandemic. However, there is still no convenient and understandable mechanism for providing such assistance and means for monitoring the distribution of funds. People do not know what to do, so that their support is guaranteed to reach those who need it. 

HealthCareCoin solves this problem. It is a charity platform that uses the latest achievements of blockchain technologies to help Covid-19 victims. The distribution of funds is transparent so that each user can track how funds are spending. At the same time, the donors themselves remain anonymous. 

HealthCareCoin Charity 

50% of the funds earned by the HealthCareCoin platform go to charity.

The HealthCareCoin project is fighting a total war against the pandemic and therefore works in three main directions. A third of the funds allocated for charitable purposes goes to each of these directions. 


1.Assistance to regions facing a difficult epidemiological situation. Hospitals in many areas of the world cannot help all their patients due to a lack of equipment (often short even on the most straightforward equipment) and medicines. HealthCareCoin will provide targeted purchase of the necessary equipment, consumables, and drugs. 

2. Targeted assistance for patients with Covid-19. Treatment and, especially, rehabilitation after coronavirus disease is an arduous and expensive process. Not all people can pay for the necessary therapy. HealthCareCoin helps those who cannot afford full-fledged treatment of Covid and its consequences. 

3. The pandemic has dealt a powerful blow to the economy. Millions of people around the world were left without work and means of livelihood. Moreover, those who survived the disease often cannot return to a full-time job and lose their income 
We understand that economic problems can kill as well as a disease itself, so the third essential task of HealthCareCoin is to help those who are in a difficult financial situation due to the pandemic 
The entire project community will determine who exactly will receive targeted assistance from HealthCareCoin through voting, in which all HCC holders will be able to participate. 
HCC Mining 

HealthCareCoin mining is carried out via ASIC according to the PoW x11 algorithm. Thus, it ensures a stable and predictable flow of tokens into circulation, which has a beneficial effect on price stability. 

Any Internet user can participate in the production of HealthCareCoin. Mining will be most effective, at least in the first months, in the HCC Pool. The HCC Pool fee will go to the charitable activities of the project.

Team 

The situation around the legislation regarding cryptocurrencies remains uncertain, especially in terms of the governments' further plans to organize regulation in this area.
